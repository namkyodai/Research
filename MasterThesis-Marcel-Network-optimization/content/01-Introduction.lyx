\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strong demands can only be met with the help of a very stringent and clear structure laid out at the beginning of the writing process. One of the most clear structuring is given by a rigorous "legal numbering" (1, 1.1, 1.1.1 etc.). It is good to know that LaTeXdoes all this formatting business without any need to renumber things yourself at each iteration and so on. Thus we strongly recommend using LaTeXfor the project. Anything else (e.g. Word) is a mess when writing an elaborate scientific text with many graphics and formulas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even a particular elusive reader should be able to quickly glean the most important thoughts, experiments and results from just looking at illustrative schematics, diagrams, and pictures with self explaining, extensive figure captions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are always parts/chapters/sections of text which are complex and important for a full description and documentation of the work, but not absolutely necessary for following the main lines of thought. It is very helpful for the somewhat more interested, but temporally limited reader if such passages of text are correspondingly marked, e.g. by a brief introductory remark to such sections, or even by moving them into appendices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definitively each chapter and ideally also each section should begin with a short guide: what is communicated in the following text, which sources (quote clearly) have been used, what are the basic concepts used and which goals are to be reached. Similarly, at the end of larger elaborations a short synopsis of the communicated content should be offered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A single font must be used throughout the thesis or report, the only exceptions being in tables, graphs, and appendices. Headings may be bolded and no more than 2 points larger than the rest of the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The page format should be single column with one and a single spacing used between the lines. Spacing of words on a line should be such that the line can be easily read. Crowding words together or leaving excessive spaces is not permitted.

For those who are using footnotes
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
Some example footnote.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, Arabic numerals are used consecutively throughout a chapter, and should normally appear at the bottom of the relevant page, keyed to the same number following the word or phrase in the text to which it refers. If a footnote is too long for the relevant page, it may be continued on the following page preceding the footnotes for that page. If the number of footnotes is very large, numbers may be restarted with each chapter.

Lists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three types of lists with the environment names 
\emph on
itemize
\emph default
, 
\emph on
enumerate
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
description
\emph default
. All lists have a separation between each item, to improve the reading of item texts spanning several lines. This item text can contain multiple paragraphs. These paragraphs are appropriately spaced and indented according to their position in the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\emph on
itemize
\emph default
 sets off list items with 
\emph on
bullets
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Of course, lists can be nested, each type up to at least four levels. One type of list can be nested within another type. 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Nested lists of the same type will change style of numbering or 
\emph on

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

Mathematical symbols and equations

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sec:math"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each formula, except for generally accepted and well-known formulas, either has to be mathematically derived, to be explained, or a literature source has to be provided. This applies especially to complex models, where each constraint should be described and explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three types of mathematical equations: (a) in-line equations, (b) displayed butunnumbered equations, and (c) displayed and numbered equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
In-line equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:inlineeq"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An in-line equation is used for particularly simple relationships which (i) do not need vertical space for integrals, fractions, etc., (ii) can be expressed without breaking the flow of the sentence, and (iii) will not be referenced again in the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 If volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 are known, the ideal gas law can be used to get a reasonable approximation for the pressure of a gas as 
\begin_inset Formula $P=nRT/V$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of moles of gas and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the gas constant.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equations that are too complex to be written as in-line equations should be "displayed", which usually means, that the equation is centered between the left and right margins or aligned at a tab stop with some indent from the left margin and some vertical space is provided above and below the equation to set it apart from the text.

\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 as a function of the molar volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V_m$
\end_inset

 and the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation*}
P = \frac{RT}{V_m-b}-\frac{a}{V_m^2}~,
\end{equation*}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation*}
\mathbf{E} = \frac{|q|}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}
\end{equation*}
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
One often has to refer back to the important equations. The standard way to do this is by referring to the equation number. Of course, in order to refer to an equation number, one must first number the equations. A consiste nt system of numberi ng equations must be adopted. Various options are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Number equations as (1), (2), etc., starting in Chapter 1 (or at the first numbered equation) and continuing until the end of the last numbered equation in the document. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Incorporate the chapter number into the equation, as in (1.1), (2.3), (4.6), etc., which means the equation numbering goes back to 1 at the beginning of each chapter. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use Roman numerals for chapter numbers, as in (I.1), (II.3), (IV.6) etc. 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example:

 The non-relativistic SchrÃ¶dinger equation for a particle of mass m subject to a potential energy function V(x) in a one-dimensional universe is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

  E \psi(x) = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{d x^2} + V(x)\psi(x)
\end{equation}
\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar = h/(2\pi)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is Plackâs constant, and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 is the total energy of the system.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equation in the example is approximately centered on the page, and the equation number is aligned by a right-tab at the right margin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To cite an equation in text, use an abbreviation if it is not the first word of the sentence. Suitable singular and plural ab breviations include eq. and eqs., Eq. and Eqs. Spell out âEquationâ when it is the first word of a sentence and when it is not accompanied by a number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The used numbering of the equation may change according to the context of the work. E.g. number them as subequations

Tables

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables should only be used to present three (3) or more items; otherwise, the data should be described in the narrative. Tables should be arranged so like material appears in columns, not rows. Information presented in tables should be sufficiently understandable so frequent reference to the narrative is unnecessary. Each table should have a title, generally appearing above the table itself. The table title and other items may be footnoted, although extensive explanations appearing in footnotes should be avoided. All abbreviations and symbols should be defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables are generally no more than what can be printed on one page, but occasionally multi-paged tables are necessary and are acceptable. Tables may appear on pages which contain narrative text or tables may appear singularly on a page (i.e. one table per page and only the table on the page).

Figures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:figures"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures present charts, graphs, or images to the reader. Figure legends should be sufficiently detailed to allow the reader to understand without frequent reference to the narrative. However, overly detailed descriptions should be avoided. All abbreviations and symbols should be defined. Figure legends should appear on the same page and in the same orientation as the figure. For example, if the figure appears in landscape mode then the legend should also appear in landscape mode. If the figure legend is too lengthy to appear on the same page as the figure, then the legend, in its entirety, must appear on the next page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to tables, figures are usually constructed to be no more than what can appear on one page, but occasionally multi-paged figures are necessary. Figures may also appear singularly on pages or on pages containing narrative text.
